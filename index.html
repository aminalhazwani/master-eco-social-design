			<h2><a class="red" href="http://www.unibz.it/it/design-art/welcome/default.html">Faculty of Design &amp; Art<br>Free University of Bozen-Bolzano</a></h2>

			<p class="strong">The forthcoming biennial Master of Arts in Eco-Social Design focusses on the potentials of local communities and economies, and on how to unfold them in a globalized world. Eco-Social Design is not only about more eco-efficient products and services, but is striving for more social good and good life with less material goods. Design is a catalyst of change.</p>

			<h3>Cornerstones and characteristics</h3>
			<p>Designers can help to envision and enable resilient projects locally, which can be adapted elsewhere – multiplied and networked globally. We use the region that we are placed in – the alps – to practice and teach ways of working, which can be applied in other regions, too.</p>
			
			<p>The Master enables young creative professionals to design for sustainable practices of production, consumption and living. With this aim the design of products, interactive applications and communications are approached as an integrated task. Students learn to work on design projects equipped with a transdisciplinary set of instruments beyond design, gathered from social and environmental sciences, economics and business, technology and crafts.</p>

			<p>Teaching and learning are organized in in multidisciplinary projects, where theory and practice are integrated in order to deal with complex questions and develop effective “answers” through the means of design. The master’s program works across several fields of design and provides possibilities to specialize in specific design disciplines, skills and/or areas of application. You will collaborate in teams, in beautiful spaces, and with external experts and stakeholders. The Faculty provides an environment that fosters creative, personal and professional development. It  offers state-of-the-art labs: from traditional crafts to rapid prototyping and physical computing, from carpentry to user experience.</p>
